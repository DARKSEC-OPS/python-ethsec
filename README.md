**Subnetting (NC) **

Subnet Mask - Tells us how big our network is and how many IPs we have. 

_Turning Binary Code to Decimal_

1. power 2's table

128   64   32   16   8   4   2   1

2. 1 = on, 0 = off

3. decode using code per octet

Binary: 11000000 . 10101000 . 00000001 . 00010101
Decimal: 192.168.1.21

11000000 . 10101000. 000100000 . 00000101 = 192.168.32.5
11111111 . 11111111. 111111111 . 00000000 = 255.255.255.0

How to find out how many IP addresses can be on this network ^^
2^n = n = number of zeros (host bits)
2^8 = 256
256 - 2 (subtract the two unusuable IP addresses, first and last one)
254 = Usable IPS

Q - I need more IP addresses what do I do? 

11000000 . 10101000. 000100000 . 00000101 = 192.168.32.5
11111111 . 11111111. 111111110 . 00000000 = 255.255.254.0

More networks = more bits... steal them from the hosts (0). Below example needs 4 more networks, create second nose person chart

128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1
256  128 64  32  16 8  4  2

 When you have the amount of networks needed = hack the bits starting from the left to the right
 When you have the amount of hosts needed = SAVE the bits from right to left and hack the ones left over

_Watched Switches and Routers EP1 EP2 for CCNA Course_

Switches and Routers NC 
- Switches = Routers but better. LAYER 2! Data Link
- CISCO packet tracer, provided two little test labs
- Routers = Allow connectivity to different servers. Layer 3! Network

_Methods of capturing traffic_

1. ARP Poisoning (MIM attack - man in the middle attack)
     - Putting yourself in between the router and the destination. Receiving all the traffic
     - Download Wireshark (apt install wireshark)
     - Download nmap (apt install nmap)
     - Download ettercap (apt install ettercap-text-only)
     - 1. Recon: sudonmap -sn <broadcast address>
         - Get this by ip a. And then take the gateway/broadcast address
         - Find desired device
     - 2. sudo ettercap -T -S -i eth0 -M arp:remote (router) /10.0.0.1// /(victim)10.0.0.129//
         - runs attack starts capturing traffic
     - 3. run wireshark (sudo wireshark)
         - filter out only traffic for victim (ip.addr == <ip address>
     - 4. analyze packets (apackets.com), upload saved pcap file

**Network Concepts**

ISO: International Organization for Standardization

_OSI Model: Open Systems Interconnection, conceptual model created by the OSI. People Do Nothing To Save People's Asses_

7. Application Layer
   - Providing services and interfaces to applications
   - ex: HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3, SMTP, IMAP
   
6. Presentation Layer
   - Makes sure the data is presentable (encoding, compression and encryption)
   - ex: ASCII or Unicode
   
5. Session Layer
   - Responsible for maintaining and synchronizing communication between application running on different hosts.
   - ex: NFS (Network File System) and RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
   
4. Transport Layer
   - Enables end-to-end communcation between running applicatations on different hosts
   - ex: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
   
3. Network Layer
   - Concerned with sending data between different networks.
   - ex: IP (internet protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), VPN (Virtual Private Network - IPSex and SSL/TLS VPN
   
Layer 2: Data Link Layer
   - The medium to transfer the signal through devices under the same network (i.e offices linked with a network switch)
   - ex: MAC address (Media Access Control)

<img width="985" height="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd8bf97c-f0fe-4a94-963d-819736398a9b" />

Layer 1: Physical Layer
   - The physical connection between devices (optical fibre cable, WIFI radio bands, 2.4G/5/6 Hz bands
   - medium: type of wire and the definition of the binary digits 0 and 1

_TCP/IP Model: developed in 1970s by the DoD. Goes top to bottom using the below layers_

Layer 5, 6, 7: Application Layer - It all starts when the user inputs the data they want to send into the application. For example, you write an email or an instant message and hit the send button. The application formats this data and starts sending it according to the application protocol used, using the layer below it, the transport layer.

Layer 4: Transport Layer - The transport layer, such as TCP or UDP, adds the proper header information and creates the TCP segment (or UDP datagram). This segment is sent to the layer below it, the network layer.

Layer 3: Internet Layer - The transport layer, such as TCP or UDP, adds the proper header information and creates the TCP segment (or UDP datagram). This segment is sent to the layer below it, the network layer.

Layer 2: Data Link Layer - The Ethernet or WiFi receives the IP packet and adds the proper header and trailer, creating a frame.

_RFC 1918 defines the following three ranges of private IP addresses:
_
    10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8)
    172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12)
    192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16)

_UDP and TCP_

UDP: User Datagram Protocol - Connectionless. Does not provide confirmation that data packets have been received by the destination. 
- Functions in Layer 4 - Transport
- Uses port numbers to identify destination (between 1 and 65535
- Faster than TDP because no confirmation is needed

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol - Connection based. 
- Layer 4 protocol
- Requires established connection before data can be sent
- Sequence number used to identify data --> receiver acknowledges data has been received
- Three-way-handshake
 1. SYN Packet: Client initiates request by sending SYN packet to the server (contains the client's randomly chosesn initial sequence number)
 2. SYN-ACK Packet: Server responds with a SYN-ACK packet with their randomly chosen number
 3. ACK Packet: Client sends an ACK packet to acknowledge the reception of the SYN-ACK Packet

Encapsulation: Every layer adding a header (sometimes a trailer)

<img width="986" height="357" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe0bc2a3-456a-4a01-ae00-fb55db552b37" />

**Network Essentials**

To access network need:
1. IP address along w/ subnet mask
2. Router (gateway/oprah)
3. DNS server

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Application level relies on UDP (server listens on UDP port  67, client sends from UDP port 68. Relies on DORA
- Discover: client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message seeking the locak DHCP server if one exists
- Offer: Server responds with a DHCPOFFER message with an IP address available for the client to accept
- Request: client responds with a DHCPREQUEST message to indicate that it has accepted the offered IP
- Acknowledge: Server responds with a DHCPACK message to confirm that the offered IP address is now assigned to the client.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Layer 2 - deals w/MAC addresses. makes it possible to find the MAC address of another device on the same ethernet

<img width="982" height="568" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76518e54-a709-40bb-9703-57a4f79c4640" />

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): 
- Ping: makes sure target is alive and measure RTT (round-trip time) to get the response back to the client
- traceroute: discovers the route from your host to the target

Routing Algorithms:
- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First): calculates most efficient path for data transmission.
- EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol): CISCO routing protocol - uses different routing algorithms too confirm which network will have the lest cost (delay)
- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol): Primary routing protocol - allows for differnt ISPs to exchange routing information and establish paths to travel between those networks
- RIP (Routing Information Protocol): Used for smaller networks. Routers share info about the networks they can reach and the number of hops (routers) required to get there. 

NAT (Network Address Translation): Allows for seamless translation of multiple private (devices) on a network 

**Networking Core Protocols**

DNS (Domain Name System): Operates in Application level - layer 7
1. A Record: A address record maps a hostname to one or more IPv4 addresses
2. AAAA Record: Same as A record but for IPv6.
3. CNAME Record: Canonical Name record. Maps a domain name to another domain name. ex - example.com mapped to www.example.com
4. MX Record: Mail exchange record specifies the mail server responsible for handling emails for a domain

HTTP / HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure). Uses TCP, typically on port 80 and 443
Common Commands
- GET: Retrieves data from the server (file or image)
- POST: allows us to submit new data to the servier (updloading a file or form)
- PUT: used to create a new resource on the server and to update and overwrite existing information
- DELETE: used to delete a specified file of resource on the server

FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Quicker than HTTP when dealing w/ file transfers. TCP port 21
Common Commands
- USER: used to input the username
- PASS: used to enter the password
- RETR: used to download a file from the FTP server to the client
- STOR: used to upload a file from the client to the FTP server

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Process in which mail client talks with a mail server and how a mail server talks to one another.  Port 25
Common Commands
- HELO or EHLO: Initiates an SMTP session
- MAIL FROM: specifies the sender's email address
- RCPT TO: specifies the recipient's email address
- DATA: inidiates that the client will begin sending the content of the email message
- . : is sent on a line by itself to indicate the end of the message

POP3 (Post Office Protocol V3): Equivalent to checking your post office for mail sent through SMTP. Port 110
Common Commands
- USER <username> identifies the user
- PASS <password> provides the userâ€™s password
- STAT requests the number of messages and total size
- LIST lists all messages and their sizes
- RETR <message_number> retrieves the specified message
- DELE <message_number> marks a message for deletion
- QUIT ends the POP3 session applying changes, such as deletions

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): allows for synchronization of mailboxes across multiple devices. Port 143
- LOGIN <username> <password> authenticates the user
- SELECT <mailbox> selects the mailbox folder to work with
- FETCH <mail_number> <data_item_name> Example fetch 3 body[] to fetch message number 3, header and body.
- MOVE <sequence_set> <mailbox> moves the specified messages to another mailbox
- COPY <sequence_set> <data_item_name> copies the specified messages to another mailbox
- LOGOUT logs out

**Networking Security Protocols**

TLS (Transport Layer Security): added to existing protocols to protect communication confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity (HTTPS, POP3S, SMTPS, IMAPS)
- Operates in the Transport Layer (4)

SSH (Secure Shell): secure way of accessing remot systems

[Let's Encrypt: Free Security Certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/)

HTTP over TLS = HTTPS: Adds a second step (establishing a TLS session) to the process
1. Establish a TCP three-way handshake with the target server
2. Establish a TLS session
  - Encrypts the content. Only way of accessing is encryption key
     - 
4. Communication using HTTP protocol, for example issuing HTTP request such as GET / HTTP/1.1

Without TLS =

With TLS = 
<img width="1032" height="745" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80585762-23ad-4e83-9caf-f2152ffc2237" />

TCP Ports

SSH (Secure Shell) - OpenSSH - Port 22
Benefits:
- Secure authentication: password based and supports public key and two-factor auth
- Confidentiality: end-to-end encryption, protecting against eavesdropping. Provides new server keys to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks
- Integrity: Cryptography protects the integrity of the traffic
- Tunneling: can create a secure "tunnel" to route other protocols through SSH. Leads to VPN-like connection
- X11 Forwarding: allows use of GUI over the network if you connect to a Unix-like system

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) - Secure file transfer, port 22

FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure)

_VPN_

<img width="997" height="672" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9b7925d-2ad8-4d8c-98cb-7042ccc09459" />

**Wireshark: The Basics**

Wireshark: An open-source tool used to perform pacjet sniffing and investigating live traffic. One of the best packet analysis tools
- used to troubleshoot network problems
- detect security anomalies (rogue hosts, abnormal port usage, and suspicious traffic
- investgate and learn protocol details such as response codes and payload data

Details Pane
- Frame/Packet: Layer1 - Physical Layer of the OSI - shows details
- SOURCE (MAC): Layer 2 - destination MAC Addresses from the Data Link layer of OSI Model
- Souce (IP): Layer 3 - Source and destination IPv4 Addresses; from the Network later of the OSI Model
- Protocol: Layer 4 - details of the UDP/TCP source and destination port. Transport Layer
- Protocol Errors - Continuation of the 4 layer shows specific segements from TCP that needed to be reassembled
- Application Protocol: Layer 5 - details specific to the protocol used (HTTP, FTP, SMB). Application Layer
- Application Data: extension of the 5th layer can show the application-specific data

**WINDOWS**

- To create an Azure Microsoft VM (https://youtu.be/X1CM3rZwGn8?si=GN8qGVM63flvn_Jn)

_Active Directory_

- Client --> Server --> DC (Domain Controller)
- Trees --> multiple domains sharing the same namespace(thm.local). USA & UK can share the same domains but they would have their own active directories, servers, and computers. (usa.thm.local & uk.thm.local)
- Forests --> Acquisition of another company. The joining of trees under the same network

sftp username@hostname: secure file transfer

-size 1033c: This specifies that the file size must be exactly 1033 bytes. The c suffix indicates bytes.

! -executable: This negates the -executable condition, meaning it finds files that are not executable.

-exec file {} +: For each file found that matches the previous criteria, the file command is executed. file determines the type of the file. The {} acts as a placeholder for the found filenames, and + ensures that file processes multiple filenames at once for efficiency.

| grep: used when searching for something specific. a text, a word, anything 
- | grep -w 'text':The output of the file command is piped to grep. grep -w 'text' then filters this output to show only lines containing the whole word "text", which is a common indicator of a human-readable file (e.g., "ASCII text", "UTF-8 Unicode text").
